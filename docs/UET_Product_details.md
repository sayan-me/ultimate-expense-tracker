## Key Features and Core Functionalities

### 1. Expense Tracking
- **Log Expenses**: Users can log their expenses with mandatory fields like date, time, amount, and account, and optional fields such as comments, category, tags, and merchant name.
- **Categories and Tags**: Users are provided with some default expense categories, e.g., food, groceries, etc.; and tags like 'good expense', 'bad expense', etc. Users can create, update, and delete categories and tags as per their requirements.
- **Expense Suggestions**: The app intelligently suggests expenses based on various data sources:
  - **SMS Data and Payment App APIs**: By analyzing transaction messages and payment app data (e.g., Google Pay), the app identifies potential expenses.
  - **Location and Weather Context**: Uses location data to suggest expenses relevant to the user's current location or weather conditions.

- **Group Owners**: Designated group owners can set group budgets, allocate funds to members, and manage group finances.
- **Shared Budgets**: Group members' income and expenses contribute to a shared budget managed by group owners.

### 5. Virtual Accounts
**Explanation**: Virtual accounts are an abstraction layer to help users better manage and organize their financial goals without the complexity of using multiple physical bank accounts. Virtual accounts are intended to give users a way to segregate funds for different purposes, like budgeting, managing loans, or saving for specific goals. This segregation can be done without requiring the user to open multiple actual bank accounts. Following are the app's features for managing the virtual accounts:
- **Create Virtual Accounts**: Users can create virtual savings and loan accounts to manage funds for specific purposes without registration.
- **Link to Actual Bank Accounts**: Virtual accounts can be mapped to real bank accounts, allowing for easy transfer and tracking of funds.
- **Automated Fund Allocation**: Users can automate the allocation of savings to different virtual accounts based on priority.
- **Loan Installment Tracking**: For loan accounts, users can:
  - Add loan installment details with due dates
  - Set reminder preferences (e.g., notify 5 days before due date)
  - Mark installments as paid with payment reference
  - Get notifications for upcoming, due, and overdue installments
  - View loan repayment history and upcoming schedule

### 6. Expense Splitting
- **Log and Split Expenses**: Group members can log expenses and split them with others in the group. Group owners can configure a limit for the group, where all the split expense requests above that limit must go through their approval before settlement. Group owners can review and approve split requests before they are settled.
- **Split Notifications**: Group owners receive push notifications for new split expense approval requests. Members receive notifications when their split requests are approved/rejected or when they have pending settlements.

### 7. Financial Insights and Dashboards
- **Personalized Dashboards**: Users can visualize their financial health, spending behavior, and savings trends with customizable graphs.
- **Group Financial Overview**: Group owners have access to a group dashboard that provides insights into group finances and member spending.

### 8. Bank Statement Import
- **Sync Income and Expenses**: Users can upload bank statements to extract transactions, with the app suggesting entries that have not been logged, ensuring comprehensive expense tracking.

### 9. Data Export/Import
- **Flexible Data Management**: Users can export and import expense data in .csv or .xlsx formats, facilitating data management across devices.

  - Budget warnings (approaching/exceeding limits)
  - Loan installment reminders
  - Split expense approvals/rejections
  - Savings goal achievements
  - Group updates

## Data Storage Requirements
This app needs to run on client side as a PWA, most of the calculations and storages will be on client's phone. We also don't want every user to store their data on remote database, as it will cost us money. We can provide remote storage of data for only paid customers. 
Appropriate datasore should be selected considering the above.
